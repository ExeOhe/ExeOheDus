# 5. Run the scanner task (checks for 2x $30K pumps)
python3 -m src.main --task scan

# 6. Or run the stream task (real-time token stream)
python3 -m src.main --task stream

## ðŸ“Š How Results Are Generated

- The scanner identifies tokens that have exceeded a $30,000 market cap at least twice in the last 7 days.
- For each qualifying token, the output includes up to the last 3 hourly market cap snapshots (one per hour, if available).
- This approach provides a clear, time-separated view of each assetâ€™s recent momentum, making it easier to spot trends and analyze token performance.
- If a token has no updates for a given hour, that hour will be skipped in the results.
- Duplicate timestamps are avoided, ensuring each hourly entry is unique and actionable.

Results are saved to `pump_results.json` for further analysis or review.
